  * Only display running players in the phone's sound menu The design
    says to only display the _one_ running player. This will have that
    effect, as there's only one player allowed to run at a time on the
    phone.
  * VolumeControl: don't pass vala closures into libpulse Libpulse's
    vala bindings don't specify that callbacks passed into some of its
    functions (e.g., get_server_info) can be called after the function
    returns. Vala thus frees closure data after these functions return.
    This can't easily be fixed in the bindings, because libpulse doesn't
    provide variants of these functions with destroy_notifies. This
    patch works around this problem by only passing non-closure
    functions into libpulse. (LP: #1244386)
  * Depend on vala 0.20 and use its GIcon.serialize().
